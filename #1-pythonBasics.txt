Here are the corrected answers with changes highlighted in **bold**:

### Practice Questions

1. **Which of the following are operators, and which are values?**
   - `*` -> **operator**
   - `'hello'` -> **value**
   - `-88.8` -> **value**
   - `-` -> **operator**
   - `/` -> **operator**
   - `+` -> **operator**
   - `5` -> **value**

2. **Which of the following is a variable, and which is a string?**
   - `spam` -> **variable**
   - `'spam'` -> **string**

3. **Name three data types.**
   - **integer, floating-point number, string**

4. **What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?**
   - **An expression is made up of values (like strings, integers, floats), variables, and operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.).**
   - **Expressions evaluate to a value.**

5. **This chapter introduced assignment statements, like `spam = 10`. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?**
   - **An expression evaluates to a value, whereas a statement performs an action (such as assignment) and does not itself evaluate to a value.**

6. **What does the variable `bacon` contain after the following code runs?**
   ```python
   bacon = 20
   bacon + 1
   ```
   - **20** (because `bacon + 1` does not modify the variable `bacon` itself; it only evaluates to `21`)

7. **What should the following two expressions evaluate to?**
   - `'spam' + 'spamspam'` -> **'spamspamspam'** (concatenation)
   - `'spam' * 3` -> **'spamspamspam'** (replication)

8. **Why is `eggs` a valid variable name while `100` is invalid?**
   - **Variable names cannot begin with a number; `eggs` starts with a letter, which is allowed.**

9. **What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?**
   - **`int()`, `float()`, `str()`**

10. **Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?**
    ```python
    'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
    ```
    - **Python doesn't allow concatenation of a string and an integer directly. To fix it, convert the integer to a string using `str(99)` like this: `'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'`**
